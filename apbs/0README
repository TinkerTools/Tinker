                     APBS Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

      This directory contains static libraries and other files needed to
      interface the Tinker package with the APBS 1.3 Poisson-Boltzmann
      solver developed by Nathan Baker's group. To build APBS-capable
      Tinker executables, use the Tinker source "pmpb.c" in place of the
      stub file "pmpb.f", then link with the APBS libraries found here.
      All of the libraries were built with the GNU compilers.
