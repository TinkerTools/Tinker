             Known Problems, Bugs and Omissions in the TINKER Code

 (1)  Torques are not yet implemented for the "3-Fold" local coordinate
      frame definition in the AMOEBA model; as needed for ammonia and
      other molecules with 3-fold symmetry.. The correct redistribution
      of torque to force must be added to the "torque.f" routine.

 (2)  The "vibrot" program computes eigenvalues and eigenvectors of the
      torsional Hessian, but does not compute torsional normal modes. This
      requires elaboration as per Levitt, Sander and Stern's 1986 JMB paper.

 (3)  The cavitation term in the nonpolar implicit solvation energy for
      the Generalized Kirkwood and Poisson-Boltzmann models is not very
      accurate, especially for folding/unfolding transitions.

 (4)  The Hessian for the MM3 vdw potential, including directional H-bonds,
      is only approximate. This does not have much if any effect on the
      convergence of NEWTON minimizations, but does result in some small
      negative vibrational frequencies for minima.
