                    Building the Tinker Package Using CMake
                    #######################################

      The Tinker package can be built using the CMake compilation utility.
      CMake works on Linux, MacOS and Windows. It requires the pkg-config
      and cmake-data packages, in addition to cmake.

      cmake is a command-line utility, and can be replaced in step 4 by
      ccmake for a text-based UI or cmake-gui for a graphical frontend.

      Note that before building Tinker, the FFTW libraries must be built or
      installed. To build these at the same time as Tinker, pass the flag
      "-DBUILD_FFTW=ON" to CMake. These libraries can also be built following
      the instructions in the file /fftw/0README. Alternatively, the libraries
      can be installed on Ubuntu Linux or similar by using the command
      "sudo apt-get installlibfftw3-dev".

      To change where Tinker executables are installed pass the flag
      "-DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/install" to CMake. This is useful
      in situations where the user may not have root privileges (e.g. on a
      computing cluster).

      To build Tinker with cmake, issue the following commands:

               (1) cd Tinker  [i.e., the top-level directory]
               (2) mkdir build && cd build
               (3) cmake ../cmake
               (4) make -j4
               (5) make install
