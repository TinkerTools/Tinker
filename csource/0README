                  -------------------------------------------
                  C Version of TINKER Translated from Fortran
                  -------------------------------------------

          The /source subdirectory holds C code for the current TINKER
          package. These source files were generated from the Fortran
          version using the translation program f2c. Please note that
          f2c does not allow DATA statements to precede other types
          of declarations. This means that any common blocks containing
          DATA statements must be included in source files at the very
          bottom of the declarations section.

          Some routines have native C versions that should be used to
          replace the corresponding Fortran without f2c translation.
          This native C code is contained in the /native subdirectory.
          Note that a "clock.c" version of the Fortran "clock.f" is
          not needed.

          To create working executables, the resulting C code must be
          compiled, then linked with the f2c object library for your
          machine type as indicated in the file link.make. C versions
          of the TINKER programs run significantly slower than native
          Fortran versions on most machines.

          While this C version of TINKER will run, we only recommend
          its use if you absolutely cannot obtain access to a Fortran
          compiler for your target system. The translated C code is not
          easily human readable, is hard to modify, is more difficult
          to build, and the resulting executables tend to be slow.
