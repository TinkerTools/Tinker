                  TINKER Notes for C Version on MacOSX/Intel
                  ------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
         be used to build the C version of the TINKER program package
         on a Linux system using the egcs C compiler. The C source
         code was generated from the master Fortran version using the
         f2c program for translation.

         The convert.make script runs f2c in order to produce C source
         code from the master Fortran version. Then the C code can be
         compiled, placed into an object library and linked to TINKER
         executables by running in order the corresponding scripts.
         Note that f2c.h must be present during compilation. Also, the
         f2c generated library, libf2c.a, is needed during the linking
         phase.

         Please note that native C versions of some TINKER routines
         are found in the /native subdirectory. These should be copied
         into the source directory before compiling the TINKER C code.
