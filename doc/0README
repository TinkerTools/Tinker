          This directory contains the documentation for the TINKER
          program package. The text and logo files were produced by
          the word processor and graphics programs of the VistaSource
          Anyware Office suite. The ".pdf" files are in Adobe Acrobat
          format, and the ".txt" files are ASCII text files.
