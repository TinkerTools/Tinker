If you would like to compile the code on the isokinetic branch of jayponder/tinker, follow he usual procedure of copying the following files into your local source/ directory:

 - compile.make
 - library.make
 - link.make
 - rename.make

Then, edit compile.make and library.make so that the files stoch_respa2.f, grad_respa.f, and empoleSR.f are compiled.

Finally:

mkdir ../bin   ;
./compile.make ;
./library.make ;
./link.make    ;
./rename.make
