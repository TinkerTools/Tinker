                   ------------------------------------------

          This directory contains the documentation for the TINKER
          program package. The text were produced by the VistaSource
          Anyware Office 2.2 Words program, and are in ".aw" files.
          If the master book file "guide.aw" becomes corrupted, an
          exact backup copy is in guide.aw-clean. If the backup is
          used, the document should be set for no hyphenation and
          the table of contents must be rebuilt.
