<T "^ajThis section contains a list of the references to general theory, algori\
 thms and implementation details which have been of use during the development \
 of the TINKER package. Methods described in some of the references have been i\
 mplemented in detail within the TINKER source code. Other references contain u\
 seful background information although the algorithms themselves are now obsole\
 te. Still other papers contain ideas or extensions planned for future inclusio\
 n in TINKER. References for specific force field parameter sets are provided i\
 n an earlier section of this User's Guide. This list is heavily skewed toward \
 biomolecules in general and proteins in particular. This bias reflects our gro\
 up's major interests; however an attempt has been made to include methods whic\
 h should be generally applicable." face:"New Century Schoolbook" size:10 >
