                 FFTW -- Fast, Parallel FFT for OpenMP TINKER
                 --------------------------------------------

      This directory contains FFTW-3.2.2 which is required by the OpenMP
      version of TINKER. In particular, TINKER needs the two fftw static
      object libraries, libfftw3.a and libfftw3_threads.a. To build fftw
      using the Intel compilers, issue the following set of commands as
      shown below. Note that the 'setenv" syntax is for csh/tcsh shells,
      and should be modified for other shells. Also. the --prefix in the
      "configure" command should be changed to the correct path on your
      local machine (ie, the current /fftw area under the TINKER tree).

      setenv CC icc
      setenv F77 ifort
      make distclean
      configure --prefix=/Users/ponder/tinker/fftw --enable-threads
      make
      make install

      After completion of the above, the libraries files used by TINKER
      will be in the /lib subdirectory.

      Note modified versions of the configure script are used to enforce
      processor-specific compiler flags. In particular, the originally
      provided version uses the -xHost option to build FFTW optimized
      for the current CPU. In the macosx and linux versions, this flag
      is replaced by -axssse3 or -axsse3, respectively, to perform a
      generic build for those systems. If, on the other hand, you want
      executables optimized for the machine type you are building on,
      then just use the original file, "configure-orig"
