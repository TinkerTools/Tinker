                 FFTW -- Fast, Parallel FFT for OpenMP TINKER
                 --------------------------------------------

      This directory contains FFTW-3.2.2 which is required by the OpenMP
      version of TINKER. In particular, TINKER needs the two fftw object
      libraries, libfftw3.a and libfftw3_threads.a. To build fftw, first
      set the Intel compilers via "setenv CC icc" and "setenv F77 ifort".
      Next invoke the configure command as:

         configure --prefix=/Users/ponder/tinker/fftw --enable-threads

      This will generate a Makefile configured to place the build under
      /Users/ponder/tinker/fftw (change this directory for your setup).
      Finally, issue the "make" and "make install" commands to build and
      install fftw. The needed libraries will be in /lib.
