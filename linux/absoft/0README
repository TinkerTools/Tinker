                TINKER Notes for Absoft Fortran on Linux/Intel
                ----------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on an Intel-based
         Linux system using the Absoft ProFortran f77 compiler.

         Due to an optimizer bug the parameter file parsing routine
         in readprm.f must be compiled without optimization.

         Several system level interface routines needed to implement
         the etime, itime, idate, iargc and getarc functions are
         contained in the Absoft specific source file absoft.f. THis
         file must be compiled and included in the object library
         prior to building executables.

         Please note that by default some Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large TINKER executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
