               TINKER Notes for Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux
               -------------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on an Intel-based
         Linux system using the Intel Fortran Compiler for Linux.

         Please note that by default some Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large TINKER executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.

         Several pairs of compile and link scripts are provided:

           compile.make   | for Intel Core 2 CPUs (SSSE3)
           link.make      |

           debug.make     | for use with symbolic debuggers
           linkd.make     |

           compopt.make   | use inter-procedure optimization (IPO)
           linkopt.make   |

           compamd.make   | for AMD Opteron CPUs (SSE2)
           linkamd.make   |

           compgui.make   | executables compatible with FFE
           linkgui.make   |

           compapbs.make  | executables compatible with APBS
           linkapbs.make  |
