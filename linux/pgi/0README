                  TINKER Notes for PGI Fortran on Linux/Intel
                  -------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on an Intel-based
         Linux system using the PGI Fortran compiler.

         Please note that by default some Linux distributions limit
         stacksize and datasize for processes as can be checked via
         the csh limit command or similar. Large TINKER executables
         will need these values increased to avoid failure at startup.
