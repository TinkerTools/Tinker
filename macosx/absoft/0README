               TINKER Notes for Absoft Fortran on Macintosh OS X
               -------------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Macintosh OS X
         system using the f77 compiler from Absoft Pro Fortran 7.0.

         Several system level interface routines needed to implement
         the etime, itime, idate, iargc and getarc functions are
         contained in the Absoft specific source file absoft.f. This
         file must be compiled and included in the object library
         prior to building executables.

         If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
         fault, check the limits for your processes by issuing the
         "limit" command at the tcsh shell prompt (or similar under
         other shells). By default, these limits are set to quite small
         values. To eliminate the problem issue the following commands:

                        limit datasize unlimited
                        limit stacksize unlimited

         These same commands can also be put in your .tcshrc file or
         equivalent startup file to be run at login time.
