                    Makefile for Building the TINKER Package
                    ----------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a Unix-style Makefile that can
          be used to build the TINKER modeling package. The provided
          file will need slight modification for use with machine and
          compiler combinations not described in the file header. The
          Makefile is a translation of the compile-library-link scripts
          found in the machine specific subdirectories. A list of the
          dependencies of source files on included files is generated
          via the TINKER "document" program by running the depend.make
          script from within the Fortran source directory. (Of course,
          this can also be done with Perl, etc.)
