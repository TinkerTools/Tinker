TINKER Implementation of the MMFF94 Force Field
-----------------------------------------------

Developed by Nicolas Staelens, University of Namur, 11/2005 to 04/2007
Further adapted for TINKER by Jay W. Ponder, Washington Univ, 02/2009

The Info.pdf file in this directory contains some comments from Nicolas
Staelens regarding his original implementation of MMFF in TINKER.

------------------
Build Instructions
------------------

To build an MMFF-capable TINKER version, make a fresh copy of the standard
TINKER source, and place the *.f and *.i files from the current directory
into the copied source directory (overwriting files of the same name). Then
compile and link new TINKER executables as usual. Once MMFF executables are
available, you may use the mmff.prm parameter file.

At some future point, we will integrate MMFF directly into the main TINKER
distribution, but for now it is being kept separate due to the extensive
MMFF-specific changes needed in the TINKER parameter setup routines.

------------------
Usage Instructions
------------------

Once MMFF executables are available, you may use the mmff.prm parameter
file just as you would any other TINKER parameter file. The only caveat
is that all MMFF "bond type = 1" bonds must be listed in the TINKER
keyfile via the MMFF-PIBOND keyword. This keyword takes as arguments the
atom numbers of atoms in type=1 bonds. Up to ten bonded atom pairs (ie,
20 atom numbers) are listed following the MMFF-PIBOND keyword. Multiple
MMFF-PIBOND keywords can be present. The MMFF bond type=1 is used for
conjugated bonds that are "single" bonds in reasonable resonance forms,
but could otherwise be double bonds in other structures. For example,
the middle C-C bond in 1,3-butadiene has an MMFF bond type of 1.

---------------------
Validation Test Cases
---------------------

The "validation" subdirectory contains a nearly complete set of files
for the MMFF Validation Suite deposited by Tom Halgren with the CCL.
Some 740 structures are provided, and the only structures missing from
the Halgren set are those with ionic heteroaromatic rings. TINKER key
files with MMFF-PIBOND keywords are provided for the 292 molecules
requiring explicit listing of bonds with MMFF bond type of 1. Output
files are provided to allow verification of energy components.
