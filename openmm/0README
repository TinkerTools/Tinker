                   Building OpenMM-Enabled Tinker Executables
                   ##########################################

       NOTE! This Tinker interface to OpenMM only works with versions
       of OpenMM available from GitHub prior to March 4th, 2021. OpenMM
       developers made major changes to their AMOEBA plugin as of that
       date which are incompatible with code in the current directory.

                   ##########################################

       This directory contains the files needed to build Tinker versions
       of the ANALYZE, BAR and DYNAMIC programs using the GPU-capable
       OpenMM libraries. The files in this directory should be copied
       into the /source directory of a clean distribution of Tinker, and
       the programs can be compiled and linked in that modified /source
       directory.

       The provided Makefile can be used, after minor edits, to build
       GPU-enabled executables. Either the GNU compilers or the Intel
       compilers can be used. The Makefile assumes OpenMM is found in
       its default location, /usr/local/openmm. NVIDIA CUDA V9 or later
       must be installed on the target machine, as well as a CUDA-capable
       graphics card.

       This version of the Tinker interface code to OpenMM only works
       correctly when built against an obsolete Github master version of
       the OpenMM package, available from https://github.com/openmm/.

       Only a limited set of Tinker options are available from within the
       Tinker-OpenMM programs, including Amber and AMOEBA force fields,
       Verlet and RESPA MD integrators, Bussi thermostat and the Monte
       Carlo barostat. Only PME periodic box calculations are supported.
