                    PARAMS Directory for the Tinker Package
                    #######################################

      This directory contains the force field parameter sets distributed
      with the Tinker package, implementing a selection of widely-used
      literature force fields as well as the AMOEBA force field now
      under development in the Ponder lab. We try to exactly reproduce
      the intent of the original authors of our distributed, third-party
      force fields. In all cases the parameter sets have been validated
      against literature reports, results as provided by the original
      developers, or calculations made with the authentic programs. With
      the few exceptions noted below, Tinker calculations can be treated
      as authentic results from the genuine force fields. Please inform
      the Tinker developers of any discrepancies. A brief description of
      each parameter set is provided below:

      amber94    Amber ff94 parameters for proteins and nucleic acids.
                 Note that N- and C-terminal amino acid charges differ
                 slightly from the authentic charge values. For these
                 terminal residues some charge is redistributed to or
                 from the alpha carbon atom; the total magnitude of the
                 redistribution is less than 0.01 e- in most cases. The
                 file reproduces the authentic ff94 energies.

      amber96    Amber ff96 parameters for proteins and nucleic acids.
                 The only changes from Amber ff94 are in the phi/psi
                 torsional parameters.

      amber98    Amber ff98 parameters for proteins and nucleic acids.
                 The only changes from Amber ff94 are in the glycosidic
                 torsional parameters.

      amber99    Amber ff99 parameters for proteins and nucleic acids.
                 Uses the Cornell, et al (parm94) electrostatic model
                 but changes several geometric values from the above
                 Amber force fields.

      amber99sb  Amber ff99sb parameters for proteins and nucleic acids.
                 The only changes from Amber ff99 are to torsional
                 parameters for phi/psi and phi'/psi', the latter being
                 the angles to the beta carbon atom.

      amber14sb  Amber ff14sb parameters for proteins as an improvement
                 on ff99sb, combined with OL15 DNA and OL3 RNA parameters
                 for nucleic acids, and TIP3P water parameters.

      amoeba     AMOEBA force field for various small organic molecules
                 based on polarizable atomic multipole electrostatics.
                 Both 2004 (amoeba04) and 2009 (amoeba09) are provided.

      amoebabio  Biopolymer parameters (protein and nucleic acid) for
                 the AMOEBA polarizable atomic multipole force field.
                 The 2009 and 2018 versions are provided. The -HFC23
                 modification of 2018 parameters from the Varma group
                 reworks many parameters involving ion interactions.

      amoebanuc  Nucleic acid parameter for the AMOEBA polarizable atomic
                 multipole force field. The 2017 version is provided.

      amoebapro  Protein parameters for the AMOEBA polarizable atomic
                 multipole force field. The original 2004 version and
                 current 2013 version are provided.

      basic      A generic parameter file intended for simple and fast
                 geometry optimization of crude structures to avoid
                 steric clashes. The bond, angle and torsion parameters
                 are set to idealized values. The vdw values are loosely
                 based on OPLS, and electrostatics is largely neglected.

      charmm19   CHARMM19 parameters for proteins and water. The nucleic
                 acid values are not yet implemented. There are some
                 differences between authentic CHARMM19 and the Tinker
                 version due to replacement of CHARMM impropers by
                 torsions for cases that involve atoms not bonded to
                 the trigonal atom and Tinker's use of all possible
                 torsions across a bond instead of a single torsion
                 per bond. 

      charmm22   CHARMM22 parameters for proteins, plus heme and lipids.
                 Most of the nucleic acid and small model compound values
                 are not yet implemented. The file almost exactly
                 reproduces authentic CHARMM energies; there are small
                 differences are related to Tinker symmetrization of some
                 improper torsions.

      charmm27   CHARMM27 parameters for proteins, plus heme and lipids.
                 Identical to CHARMM22, except for addition of a CMAP
                 torsion-torsion phi-psi correction. Most nucleic acid and
                 model compound values are not implemented. There are small
                 changes from authentic CHARMM related to symmetrization of
                 some improper torsions, as well as in the CMAP correction.

      charmm36   CHARMM36 parameters for proteins and nucleic acids. These
                 parameters include the CHARMM36m modifications intended
                 to provide a balanced model for folded and disordered
                 protein structures.

                 implemented.
