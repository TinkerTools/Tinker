              TINKER TView  --  A Modified RasMol Molecule Viewer
              ---------------------------------------------------

        This directory contains a modified version of RasMol for use
        with the TINKER package. The original source was obtained as
        RasMol version 2.6B2 during January 1998 from the anonymous ftp
        site at ftp.dcs.ed.ac.uk (129.215.160.5) as the main download
        file /pub/rasmol/v2.6beta/RasMol2.tar.gz and related files.

        Modifications have been made to provide a viewer for the TINKER
        molecular modeling package. Most of the protein specific RasMol
        options have been removed, and the only supported file type is
        the TINKER Cartesian coordinate .xyz file. The RasMol group and
        chain mechanisms have been altered so that selection is now done
        at the atom level. For example, the command "SELECT 4-6, 8" will
        select atoms 4-6 and 8 instead of residues with those numbers.

        At present this only builds and runs correctly under Linux, and
        on legacy Unix systems like SGI and Alpha. The original RasMol
        code came with source for both Windows and Macintosh. The code
        for Macintosh is for OS9 (circa 1998) and would likely need a
        complete rewrite for OSX systems. The Windows source might be
        usable, but we have not been able to get it to work.
