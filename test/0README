                     TEST Directory for the Tinker Package
                     #####################################

    This directory contains some test casess illustrating use of several
    of the programs in the Tinker package.

    For example, the argon.run file contains commands to run the first
    test case. The resulting output is found in the file argon.log.

    The clean.make script will remove any output files generated during
    these test runs, and should be invoked prior to validating Tinker
    executables against the provided log files.

    (1) ANION         Estimates the hydration free energy difference for
                      Cl- vs. Br- anion via a 10 picosecond simulation
                      of a "hybrid" anion in a box of water, followed by

    (8) DIALANINE     Finds all local minima of alanine dipeptide via a

                      you want to view the mode; this example can require
