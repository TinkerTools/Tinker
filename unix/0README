                   TINKER Notes for Legacy Unix Workstations
                   ------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains TINKER build script files for a
          variety of proprietary Unix workstations. Note that these
          scripts and the corresponding flags were all tested and
          worked correctly at one time. However, none of these have
          been used in recent years, and the scripts are only provided
          as a starting point for anyone needing to use TINKER on one
          of these workstation types.
