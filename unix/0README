                   TINKER Notes for Legacy Unix Workstations
                   ------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains TINKER build script files for a
          variety of proprietary Unix workstations. Note that these
          scripts and the corresponding flags were all tested and
          worked correctly under vendor-supplied Fortran 77 or 90/95
          compilers. However, none of these have been used in recent
          years, and the scripts are provided as a starting point
          for anyone needing to use TINKER on these workstations.
