                TINKER Notes for Alpha CPUs under HP Tru64 Unix
                -----------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on HP/Compaq
          Alpha CPU systems under Tru64 Unix and using the vendor
          Fortran (FORTRAN-77) compiler. The same code will also
          build under the Fortran 90 compiler.

          Note that use of the -om flag during the link phase greatly
          slows the linking speed, but reduces the CPU time for some
          calculations by a factor of 50% or more. The additional flag
          -WL,-om_no_inst_sched retains most of the run time advantage
          with little of the link time penalty. For linking of very
          large versions of TINKER these -om flags may need to be
          removed, or the -WL,-om_Gcommon,num flag can be added with
          "num" set as large as possible while avoiding link errors.

          If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
          fault or mystereous loader error, check the limits for your
          processes by issuing the "limit" command at a C shell prompt
          (or similar under other shells). On many workstations these
          limits are set to quite small values for ordinary users. To
          eliminate the problem issue the following three commands:

                         limit filesize unlimited
                         limit datasize unlimited
                         limit stacksize unlimited

          These same commands can also be put in your .cshrc file or
          equivalent startup file to be run at login time.
