                 TINKER Notes for Hewlett-Packard Workstations
                 ---------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on Hewlett-
          Packard workstations running under HP-UX. The developers
          no longer have access to a machine running HP-UX. The
          provided scripts are derived from ones known to work under
          HP-UX 8.05. They were tested and modified for HP-UX 10.2
          by Dr. R. Aldrin Denny.

          Note that speical HP/HP-UX code was necessary for system
          dependent routines calendar.f and clock.f to use calls to
          the U77 system library with early versions of HP-UX Fortran.
          Also the call to the "command" routine had to be commented
          under HP-UX Fortran. These changes may not be required if
          later compiler versions fully support Fortran 90/95.

          Due to an optimizer bug in a prior version of HP-UX Fortran,
          sort.f and in particular the routine sort2.f was compiled
          with the +O1 flag instead of -O2. Failure to do so breaks
          the Method of Lights neighbor search option. We do not know
          if this still applies to later compiler versions.
