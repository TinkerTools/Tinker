                 TINKER Notes for Hewlett-Packard Workstations
                 ---------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on Hewlett-
          Packard workstations running under HP-UX. The developers
          no longer have access to a machine running  HP-UX. The
          provided scripts are derived from ones known to work under
          HP-UX 8.05, and have been tested and modified for HP-UX
          10.2 by Dr. R. Aldrin Denny.

          Note that the HP/HP-UX code must be uncommented in system-
          dependent routines calendar.f and clock.f before compiling.
          HP-UX Fortran has access to the getarg routine via the U77
          system library.

          Due to an optimizer bug in earlier version of HP-UX Fortran,
          sort.f and in particular the routine sort2.f must be compiled
          with the +O1 flag instead of -O2. Failure to do so breaks
          the Method of Lights neighbor search option. We do not know
          if this still applies to later versions of the compiler.
