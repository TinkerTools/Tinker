                 TINKER Notes for IBM Systems under AIX Unix
                 -------------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on IBM AIX Unix
          machines using the xlf Fortran compiler.

          Note that IBM AIX Unix the Fortran 77 version of TINKER
          required special system-dependent version of the clock.f
          and openend.f routines. These modification should not be
          necessary for more recent compiler versions supporting the
          Fortran 95 standard, but the TINKER developers no longer
          have access to a current AIX machine for testing.
