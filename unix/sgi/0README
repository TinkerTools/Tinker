                    TINKER Notes for SGI under MIPS Compiler
                    ----------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on a Silicon
          Graphics workstation under Irix 6.5 using the SGI MIPSPro
          Fortran 7.2.1 compiler.

          In order to improve performance on SGI MIPS series CPUs the
          -mips4 compiler flag should be added for R5K and R10K-based
          machines. The corresponding flag for R4K CPUs is -mips2 and
          for R3K is -mips1. Executables created with these flags are
          not downward compatible, so -mips4 executables will not run
          on R4K-based systems, and so forth.

          If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
          fault or mystereous loader error, check the limits for your
          processes by issuing the "limit" command at a C shell prompt
          (or similar under other shells). On many workstations these
          limits are set to quite small values for ordinary users via
          the following three commands:

                         limit filesize unlimited
                         limit datasize unlimited
                         limit stacksize unlimited

          These commands can be put in your .cshrc file or equivalent
          shell startup file to be run at login time.

          Also, early versions of the SGI compiler required use of
          the access='append' option in the openend.f routine. This
          should not be necessary under later Fortran 90/95 versions.
