                    TINKER Notes for SGI under GNU Compiler
                    ---------------------------------------

          This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can
          be used to build the TINKER program package on a Silicon
          Graphics workstation under IRIX 6.5 using the GNU gcc/g77
          Fortran compiler version 3.0.1 from the SGI Freeware site.

          Note that the "pssrigid.f" source file does not compile
          correctly, perhaps due to a compiler error. As a result it
          is commented out in the compile and link scripts.

          If some or all of the executables fail via a segmentation
          fault or mystereous loader error, check the limits for your
          processes by issuing the "limit" command at a C shell prompt
          (or similar under other shells). On many workstations these
          limits are set to quite small values for ordinary users. To
          eliminate the problem issue the following three commands:

                         limit filesize unlimited
                         limit datasize unlimited
                         limit stacksize unlimited

          These same commands can also be put in your .cshrc file or
          equivalent startup file to be run at login time.
