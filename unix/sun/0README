                  TINKER Notes for Sun Machines under Solaris
                  -------------------------------------------

         This subdirectory contains a set of script files that can be
         used to build the TINKER program package on a Sun workstation
         using the native Sun compilers under Solaris. These scripts
         worked under a previous version of Solaris, but we no longer
         have access to a recent machine for testing.
