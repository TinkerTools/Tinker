                     TINKER Notes for Compaq Visual Fortran
                     --------------------------------------

           This subdirectory contains a set of batch files that can
           be used to build the TINKER program package on an Intel
           compatible PC under Windows9X/NT/2000 using the Compaq
           Visual Fortran (CVF) 6.5 compiler.

           Note that the Intel PC/Compaq Fortran code section must
           be uncommented in the system-dependent routine clock.f
           prior to compiling. There is also a special version of
           command.f which includes the DFLIB and DFPORT libraries
           in order to resolve calls to the getarg and iargc system
           routines.
